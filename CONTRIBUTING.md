Each category has its own **issue template** to help guide your submission.

### 1.1 Ask Questions

- **How?** Use our [**Question** issue template](../../issues/new?template=question.yml) to start a conversation.  
- **When?** If you’re unsure how something works or need clarification on best practices.  
- **What to include?** Provide details about your environment, any relevant code snippets, and what you’ve tried so far.

### 1.2 Give Feedback

- **How?** Use our [**Feedback** issue template](../../issues/new?template=feedback.yml).  
- **When?** If you’d like to share impressions on usability, performance, or any other aspect of the project.  
- **What to include?** Details about your context and why your feedback matters.

### 1.3 Report Bugs

- **How?** Use our [**Bug Report** issue template](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).  
- **When?** If you find something that doesn’t seem to work as intended.  
- **What to include?** Steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and any error messages or logs. Attach screenshots or code snippets if relevant.

### 1.4 Request Features

## 2. Inactive Issues & Closing Policy

- **Why we have it**: We aim to keep our issue tracker current and relevant. If a discussion falls silent for too long, we assume it’s no longer active.  
- **How it works**:  
  1. An issue that hasn’t been updated for a set period may be labeled as “stale” (or similarly noted).  
  2. After another waiting period, if there’s still no new activity or follow-up, it may be closed.  
- **Can I reopen?** Absolutely. If you find that a closed or stale-labeled issue is still relevant, you can comment on it. The maintainers will determine if it should be reopened.
